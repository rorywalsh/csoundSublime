This is an amalgamation and modification of two Sublime projects. The first is a Csound syntax highlighter and build system posted to the Csound list by Takahiko Tsuchiya. The second project is IntelliDocs (https://github.com/shortcutme/Sublime-IntelliDocs) which provides popup argument help by pressing F2. THis project has been modified so that it works with Csound source code. 

## Installation ##

 - Download the [zip-ball](https://github.com/shortcutme/Sublime-IntelliDocs/archive/master.zip) and unpack it to the Sublime packages folder:

-Windows: %APPDATA%\Sublime Text 3
-OS X: ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3
-Linux: ~/.Sublime Text 3

## Usage ##

- Select the Csound build system if it is not auto-selected. Press Ctrl+b to run Csound, and press Ctrl+c to stop Csound. Press F2 when te cursor is placed on an opcode to show arguments. 


## Thanks to ##
Takahiko Tsuchiya for creating the Csound syntax highlighter, and https://github.com/shortcutme for creating the wonderful IntelliDocs system for Sublime Editor.
