Csound syntax highlighter, build system and opcode popup support for Sublime Text 3/ 

![Screenshot](/screenshot.png)

This is an amalgamation and modification of two Sublime projects. The first is a Csound syntax highlighter and build system posted to the Csound list by Takahiko Tsuchiya. The second project is IntelliDocs:
https://github.com/shortcutme/Sublime-IntelliDocs)
and later a forked version of that repo at:
https://github.com/jbrooksuk/Intellitip

## Installation ##

 - Download the zip and unpack it to the Sublime packages folder:

 -- Windows: %APPDATA%\Sublime Text 3
 -- OS X: ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3
 -- Linux: ~/.Sublime Text 3

## Usage ##

- Select the Csound build system if it is not auto-selected. Press Ctrl(cmd)+b to run Csound, and press Ctrl+alt+c to stop Csound.


## Thanks to ##
