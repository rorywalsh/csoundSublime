This is an amalgamation and modification of two Sublime projects. The first is a Csound syntax highlighter and build system posted to the Csound list by Takahiko TSUCHIYA. The second project is IntelliDocs (https://github.com/shortcutme/Sublime-IntelliDocs) which provides popup argument help by pressing F2. THis project has been modified so that it works with Csound source code. 

## Installation ##

 - Download the [zip-ball](https://github.com/shortcutme/Sublime-IntelliDocs/archive/master.zip) and unpack to `sublime\data\packages` OR via [packageControl](https://sublime.wbond.net/)

## Usage ##

- Set your cursor over a function or object you want to look up and press F2 to see relevant documentation
